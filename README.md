## Configuration

Install this as a "generic" plugin in OJS.  The preferred installation method is through the Plugin Gallery.  To install manually via the filesystem, extract the contents of this archive to a "plumAnalytics" directory under "plugins/generic" in your OJS root.  To install via Git submodule, target that same directory path: 
```
git submodule add https://github.com/ulsdevteam/ojs-plum-plugin plugins/generic/plumAnalytics` and `git submodule update --init --recursive plugins/generic/plumAnalytics
```

Run the upgrade script to register this plugin, e.g.: 
```
php tools/upgrade.php upgrade
```

Login as a Journal Manger and navigate to the Journal for which you wish to use the Widget.  Enable the plugin via Login -> Settings -> Website -> Plugins -> Plum Analytics Artifact Widget -> Enable.

To configure the plugin, you will need to select what type of widget you want, and where it will display.  Additional options may apply to specific widget types.  See the [PlumX Widgets page](https://plu.mx/developers/widgets) for an overview of the different widget types and options.
